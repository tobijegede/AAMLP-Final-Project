```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#initialized a new rmd file
covid.cases <- read.csv("United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv", header = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
