```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
#initialized a new rmd file
covid.cases <- read.csv("United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv", header = TRUE)


#initial data pre-processing

#changing date formatting
covid.cases <- covid.cases %>% 
  mutate(submission_date = lubridate::mdy(submission_date))


#grouping the data by state
covid.cases <- covid.cases %>% 
  group_by(submission_date)

      

#count of missing data
sum(is.na(covid.cases$tot_cases)) #there is no missingness the total number of cases

```

```{r}
no.cases <- covid.cases %>% 
  filter(tot_cases == 0)

no.cases
  
```
The range of dates for which there is COVID-19 data is from CDC's website is from `r min(covid.cases$submission_date)` to `r max(covid.cases$submission_date)`. This data could be streaming, if we had a connection to the  API.
